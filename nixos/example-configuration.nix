# This configuration creates:
# - Multiple systemd services: qdrant-upload-personal-obsidian, qdrant-upload-work-docs, etc.
# - Multiple systemd timers with different schedules
# - Each source processes into its own Qdrant collection
#
# Management commands:
# - systemctl status qdrant-upload-personal-obsidian
# - systemctl list-timers | grep qdrant-upload
# - journalctl -u qdrant-upload-work-docs -f
#
# Manual execution:
# - sudo -u qdrant-upload qdrant-upload obsidian --collection personal_notes --dirs /home/user/Documents/PersonalVault
